# JqueryPhp
Server side dom manipulation wriiten on php as it's Jquery clientside counter-part

This project aims at providing a seamless, simple way to perform advanced DOM manipulation on the serverside.

IDEA
---------
 During my years as a Freelance programmer, I always toward inspiring new ways to do things. I started using nodepad++ as my favorite tool in 2012. Meanwhile, I have tried my hand on dozens of other tools as regards to finding a solution that allows for deeper possibilities and tweaking. I never regretted using WebEasy,DreamWeaver,PSD to Html, and never wanted to reinvent their likes. However, approach is to be able to do my things without software-related limitation or restrictions. That was what led me into an indepth research that discovered Notepad++.
 
 But before that, I am already a close friend to javascript. A lovely pal! But until a friend introduced me to Jquery via his blog, I never admitted that DOM manipulation could be this flawless and easy. And this is my 3rd year cruising with Jquery!
 
 Furthermore, after months of absence aways from my smart devices, I came home one thursday and decided to take a peep at my inbox and wait...... are those meant for only me?? I got huge number of messages waiting for me. But only two out of about 170 messages caught my eyes and those guys if I must say, inspired JqueryPHP as it is today.
